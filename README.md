# LondonBikes
A project to analyze London bike rides between 2015 and 2017.

The base file is the london_merged.csv file. This raw information is obtained from Kaggle:

I use pandas to clean the dataset in the file bikes.ipynb and then writing it to the Excel file london_bikes_final.xlsx. This information is subsequently used for the dashboard found on the following repository:
